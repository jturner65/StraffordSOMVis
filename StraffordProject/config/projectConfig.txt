# project-wide configuration file - do not delete this file or modify the tags that include BEGIN or END - the program relies on these to delimit zones within the config file; 
# also do not use variables or variable names that contain #, BEGIN, or END.  These are keywords for the parser and will crash things if found in inappropriate locations 
# also, do not modify the -key (==<variable name>) - values in any way without modifying the code in the SOMProjConfigData.java.
# all non-value lines should have '#' which denotes comments
#	all values should be <variable name>,<value>
#	quotes can be used for strings, they will be ignored
