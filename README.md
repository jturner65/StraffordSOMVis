# SOM Visualization Tool For Strafford Prospects
(Java/Processing/Somoclu)
This is a modification of my SOM visualization tools compatible with the Strafford prospect data format.  

This is an Eclipse (4.9.0) Java project, built with Java 1.8.0_181.  
All the required libraries to execute the visualizations (Mostly Processing library jars) are included for most platforms, along with the Jackson jars required for the JSON translation.

It includes an executable of the SOM code (based on Somoclu, but modified by me to write more output data) compiled from the c++ for Windows.
